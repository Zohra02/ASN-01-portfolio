             <p>First, the balance between digital, artificial intelligence-enabled and human customer experiences. Digital and AI-based solutions have been with for some time already, but it used to be that technology solutions were mainly used to automate back office processes and human service dominated in the front office. This has moved on. We are now seeing a much greater blend of digital and human capabilities working together at relevant points in the customer journey. It’s a trend driven by perceived changes in customer need, cost management and the desire to focus people resource on the experiences where human intervention has the greatest impact. Some customers are happy to embrace technology-based service, but significant numbers are unconvinced. In 2022, organisations will need to develop a more nuanced understanding of customers’ preferences for interacting through different channels according to the type of experience and personal context and their willingness to adapt their preferences and behaviour. As a result, there will be an increased need for insight about evolving behaviours and a heightened focus on the detailed design and execution of customer experiences and journeys.</p>
